Your new achievement, '#{class_name}' has been created.

Now you need to edit:

    app/achievements/#{file_name}.rb

and

    app/achievements/#{file_name}_observer.rb

Then you need to activate the observer, by adding ':#{file_name}_observer' to environment.rb, eg:

    config.active_record.observers = :#{file_name}_observer
